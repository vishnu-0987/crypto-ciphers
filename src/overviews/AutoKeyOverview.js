      <p>
        The AutoKey Cipher is a polyalphabetic substitution cipher used for
        encryption. It enhances the Vigen√®re Cipher by incorporating the
        plaintext into the key. Initially, a short key is chosen, and then the
        plaintext itself is appended to this key. This method ensures that each
        letter is encrypted using a different shift value, making the encryption
        more secure. It's a more complex yet effective way to obscure text by
        using the plaintext to influence the key.

const Example = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <p>Write down the plaintext message: HELLO.</p>
      <p>Choose a short key, for example, "KEY".</p>
      <p>
        Append the plaintext to the key to create the full key. The key becomes:
        KEYHELLO.
      </p>
      <p>Now, use the key to encrypt each letter of the plaintext.</p>
      <p>
        The first letter of the plaintext "H" (7th letter in the alphabet) is
        encrypted using the first letter of the key "K" (10th letter in the
        alphabet).
        <br />
        The encryption shifts "H" by 10, resulting in "R".
      </p>
      <p>
        The second letter of the plaintext "E" (4th letter in the alphabet) is
        encrypted using the second letter of the key "E" (4th letter in the
        alphabet).
        <br />
        The encryption shifts "E" by 4, resulting in "I".
      </p>
      <p>
        The third letter of the plaintext "L" (11th letter) is encrypted using
        the third letter of the key "Y" (24th letter).
        <br />
        The encryption shifts "L" by 24, resulting in "J".
      </p>
      <p>
        The fourth letter of the plaintext "L" (11th letter) is encrypted using
        the fourth letter of the key "H" (7th letter).
        <br />
        The encryption shifts "L" by 7, resulting in "S".
      </p>
      <p>
        The fifth letter of the plaintext "O" (14th letter) is encrypted using
        the fifth letter of the key "E" (4th letter).
        <br />
        The encryption shifts "O" by 4, resulting in "S".
      </p>
      <p>So, the encoded message is: RIJSS.</p>
